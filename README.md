# LazyGASPI-HS

This is an implementation of the LazyGASPI library where all processes have the same role (**homogeneous**) and data is **sharded** among them.\
LazyGASPI is the implementation of bounded staleness (https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-cui.pdf) using GASPI (http://www.gaspi.de/).

## How it works

Data (in the form of rows) is sharded and distributed among all processes (see [ShardingOptions](#so)).\
Each process acts as a server for the rows that were distributed to it (will send rows that were prefetched to the requesting client).\
[`lazygaspi_fulfill_prefetches`](#fFulfill) must be called (ideally at the end of the current iteration) in order for prefetching to occur. If the program does not resort to prefetching, there is no need to call [`lazygaspi_fulfill_prefetches`](#fFulfill).\s

<a id="idsMac"></a>
### ID's/Macros
| Segment ID | Explanation |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| <a id="idInfo"></a>`LAZYGASPI_ID_INFO = 0` | Stores the `LazyGaspiProcessInfo` of the current rank | 
| <a id="idRows"></a>`LAZYGASPI_ID_ROWS = 1` | Stores the rows assigned to the current rank |
| <a id="idCache"></a>`LAZYGASPI_ID_CACHE = 2` | Stores the cache |
| <a id="idAvail"></a>`LAZYGASPI_ID_AVAIL = 3` | The first available segment ID for allocation (not an actual segment)|

| Macro | Explanation |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| <a id="macro_hrow"></a>`LAZYGASPI_HS_HASH_ROW` | A [`CacheHash`](#ch) lambda that hashes entries by row (rows of the same table will (usually) have different positions) |
| <a id="macro_htable"></a>`LAZYGASPI_HS_HASH_TABLE` | A [`CacheHash`](#ch) lambda that hashes entries by table (rows with the same ID of different tables will (usually) have different positions) | 

<a id="strTyp"></a>
### Structures/Typedefs
<a id="so"></a>
#### `ShardingOptions (struct)`
| Type | Member | Explanation |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `lazygaspi_id_t` | `block_size` | How many rows will be assigned to a given process at a time. For example, a value of one means rows are distributed one at a time through all processes, while a value equal to the size of a table means tables are assigned one at a time.

<a id="co"></a>
#### `CachingOptions (struct)`
| Type | Member | Explanation |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `CacheHash` | `hash` | Function used to hash an entry to insert into the [`LAZYGASPI_ID_CACHE`](#idCache) segment, or `nullptr` to use [`LAZYGASPI_HS_HASH_ROW`](#macro_hrow) instead |
| `gaspi_size_t` | `size` | The amount of rows to be allocated for the cache, or `0` to allocate as many as possible, while at the same time leaving the amount of memory specified in [`lazygaspi_init`](#fInit) free |

<a id="ch"></a>
#### `CacheHash (typedef)`
Takes 3 parameters: the row ID, the table ID, and a pointer to the `LazyGaspiProcessInfo` in the `LAZYGASPI_ID_INFO` segment. `CacheHash` should then return a `gaspi_offset_t` indicating the index of the new entry in the cache.\
Value can be higher or equal to the cache's `size` (modulo `size` is used afterward).

<a id="lgpi"></a>
#### `LazyGaspiProcessInfo (struct)`

| Type | Member | Explanation |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `gaspi_rank_t`    | `id`               | The current rank, as outputted by `gaspi_proc_rank` |
| `gaspi_rank_t`    | `n`                | The total amount of ranks, as outputted by `gaspi_proc_num` |
| `lazygaspi_age_t` | `age`              | The age of the current process. This corresponds to how many times `lazygaspi_clock` has been called |
| `bool`            | `isServer`         | `true` if the current process is a **server** and `false` if it is a **client** |
| `gaspi_group_t`   | `group_id_clients` | The ID of the group of clients, or `GASPI_GROUP_ALL` if there is only one client (\*) |
| `gaspi_group_t`   | `group_id_servers` | The ID of the group of servers, or `GASPI_GROUP_ALL` if there is only one server (\*) |
| `unsigned int`    | `num_clients`      | The amount of client ranks |
| `unsigned int`    | `num_servers`      | The amount of servers |
| `lazygaspi_id_t`  | `table_amount`     | The total amount of tables stored by all servers |
| `lazygaspi_id_t`  | `table_size`       | The amount of rows in each table (same for all) |
| `gaspi_size_t`    | `row_size`         | The size of each row (same for all), in bytes |
| `lazygaspi_age_t` | `communicator`     | Member used for communication with servers | 
| `CachingOptions`  | `cacheOpts`        | The user options for how to cache read rows |
| `std::ostream*`   | `out`              | A pointer to the output stream for debugging. See [OutputCreator](#oc). |
| `bool`            | `offset_slack`     | `true` if accetable age range should be calculated from the previous age (iteration); `false` if it should be calculated from the current age (\*\*) |

(\*) In this case, collective operations should not be used. Always check either if `num_(clients/servers)` is `1` or if 
group ID is `GASPI_GROUP_ALL`.\
(\*\*) For example, if current age is 7, slack is 2 and `offset_slack` is `true`, the minimum acceptable age for a read row is 7 - 2 - 1 = 4; if `offset_slack` is `false`, the minimum age is 7 - 2 = 5.

<a id="lgrd"></a>
#### `LazyGaspiRowData (struct)`
This is the metadata associated to each row stored in the **server**.

| Type | Member | Explanation |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `lazygaspi_age_t` | `age` | The amount of times `lazygaspi_clock` had been called before row was written to server |
| `lazygaspi_id_t` | `row_id` | The ID of the associated row |
| `lazygaspi_id_t` | `table_id` | The ID of associated row's table |

<a id="sd"></a>
#### `SizeDeterminer (typedef)`
Can determine one of these: `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::table_amount`, `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::table_size` or `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::row_size`, which are henceforth considered "sizes".\
This function is called by `lazygaspi_init` after GASPI is initialized, `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::id` and `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::n` have been set and after output is created (see [OutputCreator](#oc)). This means that not only does a `SizeDeterminer` already know the rank of the current process and the total amount of ranks, but it can also output to the process's output stream.\
If a "size" is passed as a non-zero value to `lazygaspi_init` then its corresponding `SizeDeterminer` will never be called, even if it not a `nullptr` (see [`lazygaspi_init`](#fInit)), for example:
```
#define TABLE_AMOUNT 5
...
lazygaspi_init(TABLE_AMOUNT, TABLE_SIZE, ROW_SIZE, MyOutputCreator, MyCacheOptions, FREE_MEM, MyTableAmountDeterminer, ...);
//Since TABLE_AMOUNT != 0, MyTableAmountDeterminer will never be called.
```

Parameters:
- `gaspi_rank_t rank` - The rank of the current process, as outputted by `gaspi_proc_rank`.
- `gaspi_rank_t total` - The total amount of ranks, as outputted by `gaspi_proc_num`.
- `void * data` - A pointer to the data that will be used by the function. This is only used by the function itself.

\
Returns:
- The size of the corresponding member, as a `gaspi_size_t`.

<a id="oc"></a>
#### `OutputCreator (typedef)`
Responsible for creating the output stream and storing a pointer to it in this process's `LAZYGASPI_ID_INFO` segment.
This function is called by `lazygaspi_init` after GASPI is initialized, `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::id` and `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::n` are set. If `nullptr` is passed, the output stream is `std::cout`.

Parameters:
- `LazyGaspiProcessInfo*` - A pointer to the process's `LAZYGASPI_ID_INFO` segment. `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::out` must be set.

### Functions

- `GASPI_ERR_INV_RANK` if running in a single node (can also be thrown by GASPI for other reasons);
- `GASPI_ERR_INV_NUM` if a "size" was `0` and its corresponding `SizeDeterminer` was a `nullptr`.

\
(\*) All tables have the same size.

<a id="fInfo"></a>
#### `lazygaspi_get_info`

<a id="fPrefetch"></a>
#### `lazygaspi_prefetch`

For example, calling `lazygaspi_prefetch` with  `row_vec = {0, 1, 0, 3}`, `table_vec = {0, 0, 1, 1}` and `size = 4` would be valid (from table `0`, rows `0` and `1` would be prefetched; from table `1`, rows `0` and `3` would be prefetched).

## Notes

### A note on the amount of ranks

Since there are less *client* processes than running processes, `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::num_clients` should be used instead of `gaspi_proc_num` (or more easily `LazyGaspiProcessInfo::n`) for work distribution, etc...

### A note on barriers

A call to a barrier with `GASPI_GROUP_ALL` will not work (unless it times out), since servers never return from `lazygaspi_init`.
The macro `LAZYGASPI_SC_BARRIER` is defined to facilitate what would otherwise be a global barrier in other implementations:
```
...
SUCCESS_OR_DIE(LAZYGASPI_SC_BARRIER); //Replaces SUCCESS_OR_DIE(gaspi_barrier(GASPI_GROUP_ALL, GASPI_BLOCK))
...
```
